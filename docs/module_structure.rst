Quadrupole Module Layout
========================

This package has 3 modules, ``elements.py``, ``geometry.py``, and ``quadrupole.py``.

The purpose of each module is self-explanatory, but a brief mention of each will be given here.

``elements.py``
    Provides a `dataclass enumeration <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#dataclass-support>` containing the name, symbol, number, and mass of every element on the periodic table.
``geometry.py``
    Provides support for reading and manipulating molecular and crystalline geometries.
``quadrupole.py``
    Provides support for reading, manipulating, and comparing quadrupole moments.
